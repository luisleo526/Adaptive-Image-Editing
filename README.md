This repository consists of 4 parts:
- [stable](./stable): Use the pretrained stable diffusion from [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to generate test data.

- [corruption](./corruption): Modify [3DCommonCorruptions](https://github.com/EPFL-VILAB/3DCommonCorruptions) to generate clean-corrupted pairs for near focus, far focus, and fog 3d.

- [imagic](./imagic): Reproduce [Imagic](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community#imagic-stable-diffusion) and implement our Method 1.

- [sine](./sine): Reproduce [SINE](https://github.com/zhang-zx/SINE) and implement our Method 2.
